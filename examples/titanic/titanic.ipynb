Then check out\\xa0[Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial)\\xa0that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\\n\\n## The Challenge\\n\\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\\n\\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> \\n> We highly recommend\\xa0[Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial)\\xa0that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and\\xa0[this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests)\\xa0to get started.\\n\\n## Overview of How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n\\n1. **Join the Competition**  \\n    Read about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n2. **Get to Work**  \\n    Download the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n3. **Make a Submission**  \\n    Upload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n4. **Check the Leaderboard**  \\n    See how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard.\\n5. **Improve Your Score**  \\n    Check out the\\xa0[discussion forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion)\\xa0to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> \\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out Dr. Rachael Tatman’s\\xa0[video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s)\\xa0to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\n\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled\\xa0`train.csv`\\xa0and the other is titled\\xa0`test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv`\\xa0will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe\\xa0`test.csv`\\xa0dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the\\xa0`train.csv`\\xa0data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in\\xa0`test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the\\xa0[“Data” tab](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\xa0to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\n\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button  \\n    ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png)\\n2. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.  \\n    ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png)\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\n\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond\\xa0`PassengerId`\\xa0and\\xa0`Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n\\n- `PassengerId`\\xa0(sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived`\\xa0(contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n\\n- For Competition Help:\\xa0[Titanic Discussion Forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion)\\n- Technical Help:\\xa0[Kaggle Contact Us Page](https://www.kaggle.com/contact)\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\n\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data & code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks\\xa0[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks).\\n\\n## 🏃\\u200d♀Ready to Compete?\\xa0[Join the Competition Here!](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic)\\n\\n### Evaluation\\n\\nlink\\n\\nkeyboard_arrow_up\\n\\n## Goal\\n\\nIt is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.  \\nFor each in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the variable.\\n\\n## Metric\\n\\nYour score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as\\xa0[accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification).\\n\\n## Submission File Format\\n\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries\\xa0**plus**\\xa0a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.  \\n  \\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n\\n- PassengerId (sorted in any order)\\n- Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n**PassengerId,Survived**  \\n892,0  \\n893,1  \\n894,0  \\nEtc.\\n\\nYou can download an example submission file (sample_submission.csv) on the\\xa0[Data page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).\\n\\n### Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\nlink\\n\\nkeyboard_arrow_up\\n\\n## What is a Getting Started competition?\\n\\nGetting Started competitions were created by Kaggle data scientists for people who have little to no machine learning background. They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.\\n\\nGetting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.\\n\\n## How do I create and manage a team?\\n\\nWhen you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More >\\xa0[Team](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team)\\xa0page.\\n\\nWe\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the\\xa0[discussion forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion).\\n\\n## What are Notebooks?\\n\\nKaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the\\xa0[Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks)\\xa0tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our\\xa0[Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)!\\n\\n## Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?\\n\\nTo keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.\\n\\nIf your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.\\n\\n_\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"_\\xa0Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard\\xa0[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240).\\n\\n## How do I contact Support?\\n\\nKaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the\\xa0[Titanic discussion forum)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion).\\n\\nSupport is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\nIf your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please\\xa0[contact us](https://www.kaggle.com/contact).\\n\\n### Citation\\n\\nlink\\n\\nkeyboard_arrow_up\\n\\nWill Cukierski.

For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\\n\\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\\n\\nWe also include sample_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.\\n\\nData Dictionary\\nVariable\\tDefinition\\tKey\\nsurvival\\tSurvival\\t0 = No, 1 = Yes\\npclass\\tTicket class\\t1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd\\nsex\\tSex\\t\\nAge\\tAge in years\\t\\nsibsp\\t# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic\\t\\nparch\\t# of parents / children aboard the Titanic\\t\\nticket\\tTicket number\\t\\nfare\\tPassenger fare\\t\\ncabin\\tCabin number\\t\\nembarked\\tPort of Embarkation\\tC = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton\\nVariable Notes\\npclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\\n1st = Upper\\n2nd = Middle\\n3rd = Lower\\nage: Age is fractional if less than 1.

       "\n",
       "Getting Started competitions were created by Kaggle data scientists for people who have little to no machine learning background. They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.\n",
       "\n",
       "Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.\n",
       "\n",
       "## How do I create and manage a team?\n",
       "\n",
       "When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More > [Team](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team) page.\n",
       "\n",
       "We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the [discussion forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion).\n",
       "\n",
       "## What are Notebooks?\n",
       "\n",
       "Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the [Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks) tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our [Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview)!\n",
       "\n",
       "## Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?\n",
       "\n",
       "To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.\n",
       "\n",
       "If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "## How do I contact Support?\n",
       "\n",
       "Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the [Titanic discussion forum)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion).\n",
       "\n",
       "Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n",

       "A look at how we built a model to predict who survived the Titanic disaster.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   This project tackles the classic problem of predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. By analyzing passenger data, we aim to create a model that identifies factors influencing survival rates.\n",
       "*   **Goal:** To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck, based on available data such as age, sex, and class.\n",

       "### Data Preprocessing\n",
       "\n",
       "Getting the data ready for the model.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   We started by cleaning and preparing the Titanic passenger data. This involved handling various data quirks to ensure the model could learn effectively.\n",
       "*   Missing values in the dataset were replaced using mean imputation to ensure uniformity. For example, in the column 'Age', the mean value was substituted for missing entries.\n",
       "*   Normalization ensures all features are on the same scale, improving model performance. For example, a scaling process converts values like 'age' (5-90) to 0-1.\n",
       "*   Certain columns, like passenger IDs, names, ticket numbers, and cabin details were removed to help the model focus on more relevant features.\n",

       "### Pipeline Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "How the model works step-by-step.\n",
       "\n",
       "The ML pipeline consists of scaling followed by a Random Forest classifier, summarized as `{'depth': 2, 'length': 2, 'nodes': [rf, scaling]}`, with details:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The data is preprocessed to ensure that features are on a comparable scale.\n",
