## Overview

**Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series!** Happy New Year! This is the 1st episode of Season 4. We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting an approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

**Your Goal:** For this Episode of the Series, your task is to predict whether a customer continues with their account or closes it (e.g., churns). Good luck!

### Evaluation

link

keyboard_arrow_up

Submissions are evaluated on [area under the ROC curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## Submission File

For each `id` in the test set, you must predict the probability for the target variable `Exited`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,Exited
165034,0.9
165035,0.1
165036,0.5
etc.
```

### About the Tabular Playground Series

link

keyboard_arrow_up

The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

### Synthetically-Generated Datasets

Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!

### Prizes

- 1st Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise
- 2nd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise
- 3rd Place - Choice of Kaggle merchandise

**Please note:** In order to encourage more participation from beginners, Kaggle merchandise will only be awarded once per person in this series. If a person has previously won, we'll skip to the next team.

## Dataset Description

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Bank Customer Churn Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhammeshram579/bank-customer-churn-prediction) dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

## Files

- **train.csv** - the training dataset; `Exited` is the binary target
- **test.csv** - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of `Exited`
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

## About Dataset

The bank customer churn dataset is a commonly used dataset for predicting customer churn in the banking industry. It contains information on bank customers who either left the bank or continue to be a customer. The dataset includes the following attributes:

1. id
2. CustomerId: A unique identifier for each customer
3. Surname: The customer's surname or last name
4. CreditScore: A numerical value representing the customer's credit score
5. Geography: The country where the customer resides (France, Spain or Germany)
6. Gender: The customer's gender (Male or Female)
7. Age: The customer's age.
8. Tenure: The number of years the customer has been with the bank
9. Balance: The customer's account balance
10. NumOfProducts: The number of bank products the customer uses (e.g., savings account, credit card)
11. HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = yes, 0 = no)
12. IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = yes, 0 = no)
13. EstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer
14. Exited: Whether the customer has churned (1 = yes, 0 = no)
