Binary Classification with a Software Defects Dataset

Your Goal: Predict defects in C programs given various various attributes about the code.

Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

Submission File
For each id in the test set, you must predict the probability for the target variable defects. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id,defects
101763,0.5
101764,0.5
101765,0.5
etc.
