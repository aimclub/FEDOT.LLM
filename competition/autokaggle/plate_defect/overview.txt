## Overview

**Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series!** We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting an approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

**Your Goal:** Predict the probability of various defects on steel plates. Good luck!

### Evaluation

link

keyboard_arrow_up

Submissions are evaluated using [area under the ROC curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) using the predicted probabilities and the ground truth targets.

To calculate the final score, AUC is calculated for each of the 7 defect categories and then averaged. In other words, the score is the average of the individual AUC of each predicted column.

## Submission File

For each `id` in the test set, you must predict the probability for each of 7 defect categories: `Pastry`, `Z_Scratch`, `K_Scatch`, `Stains`, `Dirtiness`, `Bumps`, `Other_Faults`. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
id,Pastry,Z_Scratch,K_Scatch,Stains,Dirtiness,Bumps,Other_Faults
19219,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
19220,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
19221,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
etc.
```

### About the Tabular Playground Series

link

keyboard_arrow_up

The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

### Synthetically-Generated Datasets

Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!

### Prizes

## Dataset Description

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Steel Plates Faults](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/198/steel+plates+faults) dataset from UCI. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
